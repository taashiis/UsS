# UsS Project 
## IncogSafe [Password Manager] 

* IncogSafe, designed to store and manage passwords for various online accounts. The main objective of this project is to develop a password manager that securely stores user passwords and provides an easy way to access them when needed. 

* The password manager will have features such as password generation, and storing other sensitive information such as personal details, OVD numbers (officially Valid Documents), and notes in encrypted form. 

* The application will use encryption algorithms to protect the passwords stored in the system, ensuring that only authorized users can access them. The user interface of the password manager will be designed to be user-friendly, with easy navigation and simple instructions. 
Overall, the project aims to provide a secure and convenient solution for managing passwords, helping users 


* We conducted usability studies in many forms to get an idea of the user base, persona, features to be implemented, problem space, and how we can solve them. We used methods such as survey forms, literature review, competitor analysis and at last did a SWOT analysis on our interface.
